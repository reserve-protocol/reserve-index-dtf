/**
 * @title Folio
 * @author akshatmittal, julianmrodri, pmckelvy1, tbrent
 * @notice Folio is a backed ERC20 token with permissionless minting/redemption and a semi-permissioned rebalancing
 *   mechanism intended for rebalancing under timelock delay.
 *
 * A Folio is backed by a flexible number of ERC20 tokens of any denomination/price (within assumed ranges, see README)
 *   All tokens tracked by the Folio are required to mint/redeem. This forms the basket.
 *
 * There are 3 main roles:
 *   1. DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE: can set erc20 assets, fees, auction length, close auctions/rebalances, and deprecateFolio
 *   2. REBALANCE_MANAGER: can start/end rebalances, and end individual auctions
 *   3. AUCTION_LAUNCHER: can open auctions and end rebalances/auctions
 *
 * There is also an additional BRAND_MANAGER role that does not have any permissions. It is for off-chain use.
 *
 * AUCTION_LAUNCHER assumptions:
 *   - SHOULD NOT close auctions/rebalances to deny the rebalance dishonestly
 *   - SHOULD craft auctions against progressively narrowed BU limits to responsibly DCA into the new basket
 *   - SHOULD end the ongoing rebalance when prices have moved outside the initially-provided price ranges
 *   - if weightControl=true: SHOULD progressively narrow weight ranges to maintain the original rebalance intent
 *   - if priceControl=PARTIAL: SHOULD provide narrowed price ranges that still include the current clearing price
 *        priceControl=ATOMIC_SWAP: SHOULD fill auction atomically directly after opening AND end rebalance after
 *
 * Rebalance lifecycle:
 *   startRebalance() -> openAuction()/openAuctionUnrestricted() -> bid()/createTrustedFill() -> [optional] closeAuction()
 *
 * After a new rebalance is started by the REBALANCE_MANAGER, there is a period of time where only the AUCTION_LAUNCHER
 * can run auctions. They can specify a few different things:
 *   - The list of tokens to include in the auction; must be a subset of the tokens in the rebalance
 *   - Basket weight ranges: can progressively tighten the basket weight ranges, without backtracking
 *   - Individual token price ranges: can be a subset of the initially-provided range, if priceControl!=NONE
 *   - Rebalance limits: can progressively tighten the BU limits, without backtracking
 *
 * The AUCTION_LAUNCHER can run as many auctions as they need to. If they are close to the end of their restricted
 *   period the period will be extended automatically until a period of non-use occurs. However, they cannot extend the
 *   period indefinitely past the rebalance's end time. The final auction may extend past the rebalance's endTime, however.
 *
 * After the AUCTION_LAUNCHER's restricted period is over, anyone can open auctions until the rebalance expires. The
 *   AUCTION_LAUNCHER can always deny the unrestricted period by ending the rebalance when they are done.
 *
 * The unrestricted period exists primarily to avoid strong reliance on the AUCTION_LAUNCHER. The auctionLength should be
 *   long enough to support the price ranges provided by REBALANCE_MANAGER without excessive loss due to block precision
 *   in the case the AUCTION_LAUNCHER is not active.
 *
 * Auctions have a 30s delay at-start before bidding begins in order to ensure competition from the first block. This delay
 *   is bypassed in the priceControl=ATOMIC_SWAP case when startPrices are equal to endPrices.
 *
 * An auction for a set of tokens runs in parallel on all possible pairs simultaneously. The current price for each
 *   pair is interpolated along an exponential decay curve between their most-optimistic and most-pessimistic price
 *   estimates as a function of how much time in the auction has passed.
 *
 * In order for a pair to be eligible for an auction, the sell token must be in surplus and the buy token in deficit,
 *   as defined by balances relative to the (i) surplus: high weight * high BU limit; and (ii) deficit: low weight *
 *   low basket limit. Individual token weights can also be used to handle rebalancing independent of BU limits
 *   when the ideal relative ratios of token units is not known ahead of time.
 *
 * A Basket Unit {BU} can be defined within a (0, 1e27] range, but the typical usage defines BUs 1:1 with shares (1e18).
 *
 * Fees:
 *   - TVL fee: fee per unit time. Max 10% annually. Causes supply inflation over time, discretely once a day.
 *   - Mint fee: fee on mint. Max 5%. Does not cause supply inflation.
 *
 * After fees have been applied, the DAO takes a cut based on the configuration of the FolioDAOFeeRegistry including
 *   a minimum fee floor of 15bps. The remaining portion above 15bps is distributed to the Folio's fee recipients.
 *   Note that this means it is possible for the fee recipients to receive nothing despite configuring a nonzero fee.
